# LaunchPadder

[Simplified Chinese](README_zh-Hans.md)

## Notice

This is an introduction and feedback repository for LaunchPadder which is not open source software.

## About

![](images/launchpadder-en-00.png)

**LaunchPadder** is a free macOS LaunchPad tool that organizes and sorts apps and folders on LaunchPad according to certain rules.

Sometimes LaunchPad does not display installed application icons properly, or still shows deleted application icons even after restarting the system. At this point we need to reset it, for example using the following command.

```bash
defaults write com.apple.dock ResetLaunchPad -bool true; killall Dock
```

In earlier LaunchPad versions, the reset action automatically arranged the appâ€™s icons alphabetically, but in newer versions the arrangement is based on UUID, which creates a very confusing layout.

To solve this problem, I wrote LaunchPadder.

## Features

Currently LaunchPadder supports a variety of sorting rules, including sorting by the alphabet of the application title, sorting by application bundle group (i.e. applications from the same developer are grouped together), sorting by color of application icon and more.

* support alphabetical sorting of Latin characters and Non-Latin characters
* support sorting according to the color information of application icons
* support for putting Apple apps to the front
* support sorting by folder contents
* support placing objects matching the specified strings at the beginning or end
* support grouping and sorting by application bundle id
* support sorting by application usage
* support drag and drop to adjust the priority of rules
